# Evangelos Barberis Porfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm Evangelos Barberis, a Computer Science student at UC Santa Cruz with a passion for Human-Computer Interaction and interactive design. Through my work as a Chancellor's Undergraduate Intern and various course projects, I've developed a strong foundation in both technical development and user-centered design, using tools like Vue.js, Figma, and various programming languages.

My experience ranges from creating intuitive UI/UX designs to developing complex systems like video game emulators and FPGA implementations, always with a focus on enhancing user experience and accessibility. Currently, I'm pursuing opportunities that combine my technical skills with my interest in human-centered design, while maintaining a strong academic record with a 3.55 GPA and Dean's List recognition.

## Project Overview

### Data Structures
Contains various projects demonstrating my proficiency in data structure implementations and foundational programming concepts. These projects vary in scope and complexity, showcasing my understanding of core computer science principles.

### Web Applications
Houses my current and completed web development projects. This directory includes both small-scale applications and larger, more complex projects that demonstrate my full-stack development capabilities.

### C++ Game Emulator
Features a collaborative project where I worked with a team of five developers to create a fully functional GPU and CPU class game emulator using C++. This project showcases my abilities in systems programming and team collaboration.

## UI/UX Design Work
As part of a team project focusing on safer drug usage at concerts, I collaborated with four other undergraduates to create:

- **Hi-Fi Prototype:** [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/CPw9lznfBSRkwfc5m0fEzu/Hi-fi-prototype?node-id=0-1)

This project demonstrates my ability to apply user-centered design principles to address real-world challenges.
