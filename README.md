# Evangelos Barberis Porfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm Evangelos Barberis, a Computer Science student at UC Santa Cruz with a passion for Human-Computer Interaction and interactive design. Through my work as a Chancellor's Undergraduate Intern and various course projects, I've developed a strong foundation in both technical development and user-centered design, using tools like Vue.js, Figma, and various programming languages.

My experience ranges from creating intuitive UI/UX designs to developing complex systems like video game emulators and FPGA implementations, always with a focus on enhancing user experience and accessibility. Currently, I'm pursuing opportunities that combine my technical skills with my interest in human-centered design, while maintaining a strong academic record with a 3.55 GPA and Dean's List recognition.
