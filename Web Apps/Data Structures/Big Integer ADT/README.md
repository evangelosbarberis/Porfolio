# Introduction
Creates the big integer adt allows use to do a list of longs.

# Files used
# List.h and List.c
List.h and List.c holds the main underlying List ADT that allowed us to create a BigInteger Adt.

# BigInteger.c and BigInteger.h
BigInteger.c and BigInteger.h holds the relevenat functions while using the List ADT to create a Big Integer ADT.

# BigIntegerTest.cpp and ListTest.cpp
BigIntegerTest.cpp and ListTest.cpp all test the ADT functions with all relevent functions being tested.

# Arithmetic.cpp
Holds the client view, produces out files and reads user in files. Very simple.

# Makefile
Provided ot us, creates the exectubales for this programming assignment.
